Project for the Bayesian Machine Learning class at Skoltech, 2018

## Topic
Semi-supervised Time-Series Learning with Deep Generative Models
https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5352-semi-supervised-learning-with-deep-generative-models.pdf

## Goal
The goal of the project is to study how the model described in the paper works with time series.
Specific tasks:
1) Review the model
2) Reproduce results with MNIST
3) Modify model for time-series data
4) Apply the modified model for MWD time-series
5*) Improve model with "VampPrior" approach http://proceedings.mlr.press/v84/tomczak18a/tomczak18a.pdf
